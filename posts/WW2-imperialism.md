> analyze the major actions of Western capitalist states during and leading up to World War 2 from a dialectical and historical materialist perspective.

### **I. The Base-Superstructure Framework: Economic Necessity and Political Form**

From a historical materialist perspective, the state under capitalism is not a neutral arbiter but the *instrument of class rule*—the “executive committee of the bourgeoisie.” The policies of Western powers (Britain, France, and especially the United States) cannot be understood as mere diplomatic missteps or moral failings, but as expressions of the underlying crisis of monopoly capitalism and the dominant contradiction of the era: **the global class struggle between capital and labor, with the Soviet Union representing the first successful proletarian revolution.**

The interwar period was marked by the **crisis of overproduction**, the 1929 collapse, and capitalist states’ desperate need to:
- Preserve private property and colonial empires
- Destroy the revolutionary threat posed by communist movements
- Secure markets and resources against both rival imperialisms and socialist alternatives

Fascism emerged not as an aberration, but as a *weapon of finance capital*—a reactionary mass movement that crushed organized labor, smothered class consciousness, and preserved capitalist relations of production. Western capitalist states recognized this function and acted accordingly.

### **II. The Antithesis of “Democracy vs. Fascism”: The Appeasement Period (1933-1939)**

The **policy of appeasement** was not naïveté but a **class-coordinated strategy** to redirect German expansion eastward against the USSR. The Munich Agreement (1938) was the dialectical synthesis of this strategy: sacrificing Czechoslovakia in service of the **primary contradiction** (anti-communism) while temporarily managing a **secondary contradiction** (inter-imperialist rivalry).

Key actions expressing this logic:
- **Financial and industrial support**: U.S. and British banks (Chase National, as Parenti notes in *Blackshirts and Reds*) facilitated Nazi rearmament through loans and money laundering. Corporate giants (Ford, GM, ITT, DuPont) operated German subsidiaries producing war materiel, blurring the line between “American” and “German” capital. The base—monopoly capital—was international; superstructural “patriotism” was subordinate to class interest.
- **Non-intervention in Spain (1936-39)**: While Germany and Italy bombarded the Spanish Republic, Western powers embargoed arms to the elected government, allowing fascism to triumph over a coalition that included communists, socialists, and anarchists. The goal: **prevent a workers’ state** on France’s border.
- **Immigration restrictions**: The U.S. and Britain refused Jewish refugees, not from xenophobia alone, but because refugee influxes might strengthen left-wing movements and challenge labor market stability.

**Thesis**: The bourgeois state’s appeasement was a **dialectical negation** of its own democratic pretensions—sacrificing democratic forms to preserve capitalist content.

### **III. The War Period: Contradictions in Motion (1939-1945)**

When inter-imperialist rivalry (Germany vs. Anglo-French-American capital) erupted into open war, the contradiction did not disappear but **intensified and transformed**. The Western powers now faced:
1. **The immediate threat of German fascism conquering Europe** (a threat to their own empires and capital)
2. **The long-term threat of Soviet victory inspiring global revolution** (an existential threat to capitalism itself)

This produced a **dual policy**:

**A. Military Alliance (Thesis)**: The United Front against fascism was a **tactical necessity**, not a strategic convergence. Lend-Lease aid to the USSR was grudging, delayed, and calibrated to ensure the Soviet Union would bear the brunt of the fighting. The delay in opening a second front (until June 1944) reflects the **dialectical tension**: Western capital wanted Hitler defeated but also wanted the USSR weakened.

**B. Class Preservation (Antithesis)**: Simultaneously, the U.S. and Britain:
- Spared corporate assets from bombing (Ford’s Cologne plant, as Parenti documents), prioritizing private property over military efficacy
- Undermined communist-led resistance movements (the Italian partisans, Greek ELAS) while supporting conservative, monarchist, or even former fascist elements
- Prepared post-war plans (Morgenthau Plan initially, then reversal) designed to **reconstruct German capitalism** as a bulwark against the USSR

**The Negation**: The war was fought *against* fascist political forms while preserving the *capitalist economic base* that spawned fascism. The contradiction resolved temporarily in the **synthesis** of military victory but ideological continuity.

### **IV. The Post-War Period: Fascism’s Aufhebung and the Cold War Synthesis**

The dialectical outcome of WWII was the **sublation (Aufhebung)** of fascism: it was *negated* as a defeated enemy but *preserved* as a functional tool within the anti-communist order.

**A. The Reconstitution of the State Apparatus**: Parenti’s observation is crucial: “the police courts, military, security agencies, and bureaucracy remained largely staffed by those who had served the former fascist regimes.” This was **no accident**. The U.S. occupation (particularly in West Germany and Italy) consciously preserved the repressive superstructure because:
- It could be wielded against the working class and communist parties
- It embodied technical expertise in counterinsurgency valuable for the Cold War
- It represented continuity of property relations

**B. The Rehabilitation of Class Allies**: The release of fascists and jailing of communist partisans reflects the **law of instrumentality**: the state rewards those who serve capital and punishes those who threaten it. The Nurember Trials were a **spectacle of juridical formalism**—a superstructural cleansing that left the economic base untouched. Meanwhile, the CIA absorbed the Gehlen Organization (Nazi intelligence) and protected war criminals like Klaus Barbie.

**C. Corporate Impunity**: Parenti’s examples (ITT, GM receiving reparations for bombed Nazi-owned plants) reveal the **dialectic of legalism**: treason is redefined when committed by capital. The state *indemnifies* rather than *prosecutes* because the corporation is a legal-personification of the bourgeoisie itself.

**Contradiction Resolved**: The post-war order synthesized WWII’s outcome into a **higher stage of imperialism**—the Cold War—where former fascists became anti-communist allies and corporate collaborators became recipients of state welfare.

### **V. The Dialectical Totality: Anti-Communism as the Motive Force**

The **principal contradiction** throughout 1933-1945 was **capitalism vs. communism**, not democracy vs. fascism. Inter-imperialist rivalry was secondary and temporary. This explains:
- **Consistency**: Western powers consistently prioritized anti-communism over democracy, even when it meant enabling fascism
- **Transformation**: When fascism became a rival imperialism, it was defeated militarily but its *class function* was absorbed into the Western bloc
- **Negation**: The “victory over fascism” was negated by the **restoration of capitalism** in the West and the **suppression of revolutionary potential** globally (Greece, Italy, France, Korea)

From this perspective, WWII was not a war *for* democracy but a **defensive reaction** by one faction of imperialism against another, followed by a **counter-revolutionary consolidation** against the socialist alternative. The working class paid in blood, while capital emerged restructured and re-legitimized.

### **Conclusion**

The actions of Western capitalist states reveal the **dialectical unity of opposites**: they could fight fascism militarily while preserving its socio-economic essence, just as they could proclaim democracy while jailing partisans. The historical-materialist lesson is that **fascism is capitalism’s emergency brake**, and the bourgeois state will always choose to preserve the train—even on a genocidal track—rather than allow workers to seize the engine.
