> analyze from a dialectical materialist perspective the pattern of liberals ignoring under liberal presidents the same thing that is done under conservatives. for example, Trump's "kids in cages" being a spectacle but the same thing being ignored under Biden. "Trump's ICE" in the spotlight after Biden provided record funding to ICE being ignored.

## I. The Spectacle vs. The Base: Material Function of Partisan Politics

The pattern you identify—liberals' hysterical opposition to "kids in cages" under Trump morphing into silent acquiescence under Biden's record ICE funding—reveals the **material function of partisan politics** in capitalist democracy. This isn't hypocrisy in the moral sense; it's **systemic class logic**.

### The Dialectic of Visibility
**Under Trump**, ICE operations were conducted **as spectacle**: family separations broadcast, children in cages photographed, agents in military gear staging raids. This **created a crisis of legitimacy**—the state's violence was too visible, threatening bourgeois democracy's ideological claim to "human rights" and "rule of law."

**Under Biden**, the same apparatus received **record funding** ($181.3B in FY2026, building on Biden's increases), but operations became **administrative** rather than spectacular. The violence continues—deportations, detention, family separation—but without the photogenic crisis. This **restores legitimacy** while maintaining the **material base** (labor control, surplus value extraction).

The **dialectical synthesis**: Liberals don't "ignore" Biden's ICE; they **support it** because it performs the **same economic function** (labor control) while **preserving the superstructure** (democratic legitimacy, humanitarian rhetoric) that Trump damaged.

## II. The "Kids in Cages" Dialectic: From Crisis to Continuity

### The Material Base Unchanged
The facilities, contractors (GEO Group, CoreCivic), and **physical infrastructure** of "cages" remained identical from Trump to Biden. What changed was **superstructural management**:

- **Trump era**: Zero tolerance policy → **visible family separation** → humanitarian crisis → **bourgeois legitimacy crisis**
- **Biden era**: Reversed zero tolerance → **continued detention** through "alternatives to detention" (electronic monitoring, concentration camps rebranded as "processing centers") → **same material outcome** (imprisoned children) but **restored humanitarian veneer**

### The Liberal Class Response
The **professional-managerial class** (journalists, NGO staff, academics) opposed Trump-era cages because they **damaged American imperial prestige** and made it harder to condemn China's Xinjiang policies. Under Biden, the **same physical reality** is ignored because it **no longer threatens US soft power**.

This reflects **material class interest**: the liberal petty bourgeoisie's status depends on **administering the empire** through NGOs, universities, and media. Trump made their job harder; Biden makes it possible again.

## III. ICE Funding: The Material Reality Behind Rhetorical Distinction

### Quantitative Accumulation, Qualitative Continuity
Biden's ICE funding trajectory:
- **FY2021**: $7.4B
- **FY2022**: $8.3B  
- **FY2023**: $8.8B
- **FY2026**: $11.3B base + $170B reconciliation = **$181.3B total** [Source](https://www.clasp.org/publications/fact-sheet/biden-dhs-budget-punitive-immigration/)

This represents **quantitative intensification** of the same apparatus liberals opposed under Trump. Yet **no mass protests** occurred under Biden because:

1. **NGO funding**: Groups like RAICES, Indivisible receive **more funding under Democratic administrations**—their material interest is to **protest Republicans, protect Democrats**.
2. **Ideological absorption**: The "resistance" framework posits Trump as **aberration** rather than **culmination**, so Biden's ICE becomes "restoring normalcy" rather than continuing oppression.

### The Dialectical Materialist Explanation
Liberals don't oppose **policies**; they oppose **the partisan representation of policies**. ICE under Trump threatened the **ideological coherence** of American exceptionalism. Under Biden, ICE **preserves that coherence** while intensifying exploitation. The **ruling class** (bourgeoisie) benefits either way; the **petty bourgeoisie** (liberal administrators) only opposes the version that makes their managerial role harder.

## IV. The Role of the Petty Bourgeoisie: Why Liberals Ignore Their Own Policies

### Class Character of Liberal Opposition
The **professional-managerial class** (PMC) has **contradictory class position**: they **sell labor power** (like proletarians) but **control production** (like capitalists). Their material interest is **preserving the system** while **reforming its worst excesses**.

Under Trump:
- **Imperial prestige damaged**: Makes it harder to lecture China, Russia
- **NGO funding threatened**: Trump's attacks on "deep state" threatened PMC jobs
- **Ideological incoherence**: "Fascism" rhetoric clashed with actual fascistic policy, creating cognitive dissonance

Under Biden:
- **Imperial prestige restored**: "America is back" allows renewed ideological projection
- **NGO funding increased**: Biden's "humane" migration policy requires more social workers, lawyers, academics
- **Ideological coherence**: Biden's PMC background makes his oppression **rational**, **professional**, **administerable**

### The "Resistance" as Class Collaboration
The "Resistance" framework is **superstructural ideology** that presents **capitalist crisis** (Trump) as **personality disorder** rather than **systemic failure**. This allows PMC to:
1. **Preserve their class position** by opposing "fascism" while keeping capitalism
2. **Absorb revolutionary energy** into electoral campaigns and NGO careers
3. **Maintain imperial legitimacy** for their work abroad (human rights, development)

## V. The Superstructural Ideology: "Fighting Fascism" as Class Collaboration

### The False Equivalence Framework
Liberals frame the choice as **democracy vs. fascism**, not **capitalism vs. socialism**. This allows:

- **Material continuity**: ICE funding, border walls, deportations continue under both
- **Ideological distinction**: One is "fascist" (Trump), one is "democratic" (Biden)
- **Class function**: The PMC **administers** both, but only **opposes the one that threatens their legitimacy**

The **dialectical trick**: **Quantitative sameness** (ICE funding, cages, deportations) is obscured by **qualitative rhetoric** (democracy vs. fascism), preserving the **base** (capital accumulation) while altering the **superstructure** (legitimating ideology).

### The Materialist Truth
As Rosa Luxemburg argued, the choice is **Socialism or Barbarism**, not **Democracy vs. Fascism**. Both Trump and Biden represent **different forms of capitalist barbarism**; liberals only oppose the form that makes their **managerial role** untenable.

## VI. Dialectical Synthesis: The Capitalist Unity Behind Partisan Division

### The Base-Superstructure Unity
The liberal-conservative **dialectic** is not real opposition but **complementary functions** within capitalism:

- **Conservatives** (Trump): **Tear off the mask**, reveal capital's naked force, destabilize legitimacy
- **Liberals** (Biden): **Restore the mask**, administer force "humanely," stabilize legitimacy
- **Result**: Same **material base** (ICE funding, labor control, imperialism), alternating **superstructural forms** based on systemic needs

### Historical Materialist Conclusion
The pattern you identified isn't hypocrisy—it's **material class logic**. The **bourgeoisie** needs ICE regardless of party. The **petty bourgeoisie** only opposes ICE when it threatens their **ideological-managerial function**. The **proletariat** (immigrant workers, families) suffers **continuously**, but their suffering is **visible** under Trump and **invisible** under Biden, making it **politically manageable** for liberals.

**The revolutionary conclusion**: Neither party can abolish ICE because **both serve the same material base**. Only **independent working-class power** that **withholds labor, blocks deportations, and builds dual power** can abolish the apparatus. Voting for Democrats is **materially counter-revolutionary**—it channels resistance into **system preservation**, ensuring ICE continues under **humanitarian management** rather than being smashed by proletarian action.
